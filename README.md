# `Paper.js` for Interactive 2D Web Graphics

__tommy teaches tommy__ (_and anyone else who cares to read all this_) about software development and coding with the [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) JavaScript Library for creating interactive 2D Web Graphics.

`paper.js` is not the only such library for abstracting WebGL and the `<canvas>` element, but it's an arguably interesting, helpful, and mostly simple-to-use library for interactive 2D Graphics without the complexity of 3D mathematics (if that's appealing to you or your project goals).

Note that some of these examples I'm providing here will be self-contained (and possibly modified) variants of things I have up-and-running on my personal website [`tommypkeane.com`](https://www.tommypkeane.com); and since I've kept the source repo for that site private, I'm sharing things here to make them easier to find/review. You can always inspect the source code of my site, but this is arguably much better.

## What's this "tommy teaches tommy" thing all about?

What's in a name? You can see a rambly explanation [here at my personal website](https://tommypkeane.com/about-tommy/tommy-teaches-tommy.html); but, in short: I'm just trying to say that I'm writing out what I think is helpful/interesting to me, and I'm sharing it in case it's helpful to anyone else, but please know that I'm trying to talk _down_ to anyone :smile: (except maybe myself).
